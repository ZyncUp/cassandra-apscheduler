# cassandra-apscheduler

This is a fork of the awesome Python library APScheduler. Advanced Python Scheduler (APScheduler) is a Python library that lets you schedule your Python code to be executed later, either just once or periodically. You 
can add new jobs or remove old ones on the fly as you please. This version has capabilities to use a
Datastax Cassandra cluster as a backend for storing jobs. The scheduler can use cassandra as a backend
job store using 'cassandra' as an argument. An example implementation can be found in the examples/jobstores
directory.
